AnnexB handling
	* AnnexB handling is useful for RTP; make this a runtime option;
	currently it is compile-time.

Decoder cancel
	* returning != 0 from a vpu_decoded() callback stops the decoder,
	but resuming doesn't flush out the remaining frames. For testing,
	hack shcodecs-dec to always return 1 from the decoded callback, and
	try to get the original/correct output
	==> then use this to rate-limit buffers in omxil-sh

Compile options
	* (dec-enc-optional branch) make encode or decode disablable at
	compile time
	* make libshcodecs _native_ x86 build possible for building docs
	(with no library output)

Encode
	* check first frame of encoded video: is from previous video?
	If so, clear frame data before starting encode.

Tools
-----

shcodecs-play

	* print error if cannot init decoder (eg. no size given)

	* handle float framerate values (eg. shcodecs-play -r 29.97)
